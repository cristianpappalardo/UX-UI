    <h1>Main Heading</h1>
    <p>
        This is the first paragraph under the main heading. It contains some 
        <strong>bold text</strong> to emphasize important ideas and some 
        <em>italic text</em> to highlight subtle points. 
        Here is a <span style="background-color: yellow;">highlighted phrase</span> using a span element.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another short paragraph goes here. You can use HTML to structure content 
        clearly and make it easier to read.
    </p>

    <h2>Section Heading</h2>
    <p>
        This section introduces a new topic. Notice how headings help organize 
        your content. This sentence includes a <strong>strong emphasis</strong> 
        and an <em>emphasized phrase</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Subsection Heading</h3>
    <p>
        As you move down heading levels, the content becomes more specific. 
        Here’s a <span style="color: blue;">blue highlighted span</span> to show 
        how spans can style inline text.
    </p>

    <h4>Smaller Heading</h4>
    <p>
        Headings from h1 to h6 help create a clear hierarchy. This paragraph 
        demonstrates how text flows under an h4 heading.
    </p>

    <h5>Even Smaller Heading</h5>
    <p>
        You won’t use h5 and h6 as often, but they’re useful for deep structure. 
        This paragraph includes <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text again.
    </p>

    <h6>Smallest Heading</h6>
    <p>
        This is the smallest heading level. A <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">styled span</span> 
        can draw attention to specific words without affecting the whole paragraph.
    </p>
