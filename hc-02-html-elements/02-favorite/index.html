    <h1>Why I Love Pizza</h1>
    <p>
        Pizza is one of the most <strong>delicious</strong> and universally loved foods in the world. 
        From its crispy crust to its gooey cheese, every bite feels like a small celebration. 
        Some people enjoy simple toppings, while others prefer bold flavors like spicy pepperoni or 
        fresh vegetables. My personal favorite is a classic margherita with a 
        <span style="background-color: yellow;">perfectly baked crust</span>.

    <h2>How Pizza Brings People Together</h2>
    <p>
        Whether it's a family dinner, a party with friends, or a late‑night snack, pizza has a 
        special way of bringing people together. Sharing a pizza creates moments of joy and 
        connection. Even choosing toppings can turn into a fun debate—sometimes a very 
        <em>important</em> one. After all, not everyone agrees on pineapple.

    <h3>The Endless Variety of Pizza</h3>
    <p>
        One of the best things about pizza is its incredible variety. You can find thin crust, 
        deep dish, stuffed crust, or even gluten‑free versions. There are pizzas inspired by 
        different cultures, each adding its own twist. The world of pizza is full of 
        <strong>creative possibilities</strong>, and every style has its own charm. 
        Some restaurants even offer dessert pizzas topped with chocolate or fruit, making pizza 
        a truly <span style="color: red;">versatile food</span>.
