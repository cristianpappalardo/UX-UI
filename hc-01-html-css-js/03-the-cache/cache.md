1.What does ?v=1.0 do?
	The	?v=1.0 is a parameter in a URL code the means the first version of a file or resource. 
	It is also used to bypass the browser's cache forcing a fresh download of that file or resource even if it already exists in the cache.
	This assures that the users get the intended resource and not an outdated version.
	
2.How does the browser cache work?
	The browser cache is a temporary storage where resources are saved in order to reduce loading times.
	When the user visits a website some resources are saved in the cache so if the user visits the page again the browser does not have to start a new request to retrieve the resources but it can retrieve them from the cache.
	The resources stored in the cache are valid for a limited time.
	The browser knows if the resources are still valid by checking with the server.
	Usually sensitive informations are not stored in the cache.
